    "## THE NET PROMOTER SCORE\n",
    "Net Promoter Score, more commonly known as NPS, is a [customer success metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_success) that quantifies customer satisfaction. You've probably been asked to fill in surveys that contained some variation of the question \"How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?\" and whose possible answers were 11 numbers on a scale from 0 to 10.\n",

    "By proxy each of these categories are gauged as follows:\n",

    "- `Detractors`: Unhappy customers who share their negative experience with the product or company; they may actively spread negative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Passives`: Customers who may be pleased with the product, but aren't actively promoting it and will quickly turn to the competition if a better opportunity presents itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Promoters`: Extremely satisfied customers who will act as brand ambassadors.\n",

The company can begin by surveying its customers to get feedback and gain some understanding as to what's driving this apparent insatisfaction.

Once we have this feedback, we can act upon it as see how it impacts our NPS; hopefully it will improve it.\n",
